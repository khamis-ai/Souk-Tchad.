# Souk-Tchad.
Designed to create a mobile application (Android/iOS) and web platform to sell my products online in Chad. The application should display products as advertisements with photos and videos. When a customer opens the application, the products should be immediately visible.

**Main Requirements**:  
1. **No Mandatory Account Creation**: Customers should not be required to create an account to use the application.  
2. **No Integrated Payment System**: Customers should not be required to pay through the application.  
3. **WhatsApp Integration**:  
   - A green "Contact via WhatsApp" button should be displayed under each product.  
   - When the customer clicks this button, they are redirected to WhatsApp to chat with me.  
   - A photo and the name of the product should be automatically sent in the WhatsApp message if the customer has the application and a WhatsApp account.  
   - The product price should also be displayed.  
4. **Search Bar**: Customers should be able to search for specific products.  
5. **Product Categorization**: Products should be sorted by category.  
6. **Private Interface**: A private interface should be available only to me, where I can create folders for my products.  

**Recommended Technologies**:  
- **Frontend**: React Native for the mobile application, React.js for the web version.  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for managing products and categories.  
- **Database**: MongoDB to store product information.  
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Use the WhatsApp Business API for redirection and automatic message sending.  

**Additional Features**:  
- **Product Gallery**: Products should be displayed in a grid or list format, with images and videos.  
- **Filters**: Customers should be able to filter products by category, price, etc.  
- **Admin Interface**: A private interface to manage products (add, delete, modify).  

**Additional Instructions**:  
- The application should be simple, intuitive, and quick to load.  
- The design should be modern and tailored to Chadian users.  
- Ensure the application is optimized for slow internet connections.
